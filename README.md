This Burp Extension was created by Certus Cybersecurity to help find type confusion vulnerablities in applications.

### What is this repository for? ###

This extension complements Burp's active scanner by substituting integer and booleean JSON values with their string equivalents to check if variable types are being checked on the server's side.

For more information, please refer to the blogpost at https://certuscybersecurity.com/!!!!!!!!

### How do I get set up? ###

Ensure you have Jython standalone JAR file attached to Burp and import the extension.py file. 


### Who do I talk to? ###

Use Github issues to raise any problems.
